"""Recall and precision for chamnan's redactor, against a labelled corpus, as two numbers.

The published head-to-head on 818 repositories and 15,084 true secrets puts Gitleaks at 46%
precision / 88% recall, GitHub's own scanner at 75% / 6%, and git-secrets at 1% / 23%. No scanner
wins both axes, so chamnan's will not either, and a README that claims "credentials are stripped"
without a pair of numbers beside it is claiming something nobody has measured.

The single largest gain in that literature is verification by live API call -- TruffleHog moves from
6% to 90% precision by asking the provider whether the key works. chamnan's no-network rule
forecloses that permanently. That is a ceiling, not an oversight, and it belongs in the README.

Every string below is synthetic. Keys are made of the right SHAPE and obviously fake characters;
nothing here has ever been valid anywhere.

    python3 redaction/recall.py [--verbose] [--chamnan <path to chamnan>]

🐛 [2026-09-06] The README attributed its recall and precision figures to this path and this file
was not IN the published repository -- it lived only in the workspace chamnan is developed in. Two
numbers a reader is asked to trust, credited to a tool they cannot run. It ships here now, and it
locates `lib/` from its own position so it works from a clean clone with nothing installed.

# 🐛 [2026-09-11] One blended recall figure over sixty cases, which is the shape of number
# this file exists to make checkable and was not. Raised by a reader (`peterbuildssecure`, dev.to,
# 2026-09-09): *"a pipeline can hit strong recall on straightforward single-shot payloads while
# systematically missing anything that requires chaining, and a blended recall number hides that
# completely."*
#
# It had already happened here. A credential sitting under a CSV column header leaked in EVERY
# language, English included, while the aggregate never moved — a strong prefixed-token class
# carrying a broken column class on its back. The FIX for that shipped in 1.25; the MEASUREMENT that
# would have caught it did not, so the same blindness was still available to the next weak class.
#
# Classified by the SHAPE OF THE TEXT, never by whether the secret carries a vendor prefix. Deriving
# the class from the redactor's own prefix list would be circular: a prefix the redactor forgot
# would silently move its case from the easy class to the hard one and the two rates would both
# drift to meet in the middle. Structure is decided by the corpus, not by the thing under test.

# 🐛 [2026-09-11] Stratifying the corpus by shape found that the `column` class had ZERO
# cases in it. The published recall figure — quoted in the release notes and in outreach — was
# computed over a corpus that did not sample the one class that actually leaked: a credential under
# a CSV column header, which escaped in every language including English until 1.25 fixed it. The
# fix has checks in the suite; the NUMBER this file publishes was still blind to the class.
#
# You cannot see a weak class you do not sample, which is the whole of the reader's argument and is
# why an empty class is worse than a low one — it does not even appear in the breakdown as a zero.
#
# DERIVED from `redact._HEADER_LANGS`, the list the redactor itself claims to cover, so a language
# added there is measured by existing rather than by somebody remembering to add a case here. That
# is the same rule this repository states as "assert the population, not the instance", and a
# hand-written copy of a 16-language list is exactly how the two drift apart.

# constant in a committed file is how this workspace has tripped its own publication guard before.

# ordinary WORD and wrong for one anchored on `ghp_` or `AKIA`: a provider prefix is proof on its
# own, so what precedes it cannot make it not-a-credential. The URL rule had the same guard, and a
# diff hunk begins every removed line with `-`. Fixing all 23 changed nothing on 1,193 real files.
